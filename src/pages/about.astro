    <section>
      <p>
        I'm a creative technologist at
        <a href="#" class="avatar-link">
          <img
            src="https://placehold.co/20x20/090e24/ffffff?text=A"

        interactive prototypes, front-end infrastructure, data dashboards, and
        internal tooling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before that, I led the craft team at a small studio, collaborating with
        clients across healthcare, logistics, and education. I helped shape
        everything from brand systems to production codebases.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started as a backend developer writing APIs and batch jobs. Over time
        I gravitated toward the visual side of the stack. That foundation still
        helps me reason about architecture, performance, and edge cases in ways
        that make the final product more resilient.

    <!-- Philosophy section -->
    <SectionHeader id="on-craft" title="On craft and curiosity" />
    <p>
      I believe the best work happens when you stay close to the material.
      Whether that's pushing pixels, tuning an animation curve, or profiling a
      slow query, direct contact with the medium keeps ideas honest. Tools
      change, but the instinct to tinker sticks around.
    </p>
    <section class="mb-6">
      <blockquote>
        The gap between an idea and something real is where the interesting
        problems live. I like working in that gap.
      </blockquote>
    </section>
    <p>
      Lately I've been spending time with generative art, physics simulations,
      and small creative tools. These side explorations keep me sharp and
      regularly feed back into my day-to-day work in unexpected ways.

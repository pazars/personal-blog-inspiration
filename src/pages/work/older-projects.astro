  <Fragment slot="brief">
    <p>
      A collection of earlier work spanning brand identity, marketing sites,
      and internal tools. These projects shaped the foundations of my
      craft--learning to ship under constraints, iterate quickly, and
      balance aesthetics with function.

  <Fragment slot="overview">
    <p>
      Each project brought different challenges: tight timelines, unfamiliar
      domains, small teams wearing many hats. The common thread was a bias
      toward building and learning by doing rather than planning in the
      abstract.

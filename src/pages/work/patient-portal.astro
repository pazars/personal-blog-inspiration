  <Fragment slot="brief">
    <p>
      A regional health network needed a patient-facing portal that could
      handle appointment scheduling, lab results, and secure messaging--all
      without overwhelming less tech-savvy users. The existing system was
      clunky and underused.
    </p>

  <Fragment slot="overview">
    <p>
      We rebuilt the portal from scratch with a focus on clarity and
      progressive disclosure. Patients could accomplish common tasks in
      two taps, and the care team saw a measurable increase in portal
      adoption within the first quarter after launch.

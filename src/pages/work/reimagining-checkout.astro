  <Fragment slot="brief">
    <p>
      An e-commerce platform was losing customers at checkout. The existing
      flow was long, confusing, and riddled with friction points--from
      redundant form fields to unclear shipping options. Conversion rates
      had plateaued well below industry benchmarks.

  <Fragment slot="overview">
    <p>
      We redesigned the checkout into a streamlined single-page experience
      with smart defaults, inline validation, and a clear progress
      indicator. Post-launch data showed a meaningful lift in completion
      rates and a drop in support tickets related to ordering issues.

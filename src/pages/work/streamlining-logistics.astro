    <p>
      A growing freight startup needed to replace a patchwork of spreadsheets
      and manual processes with a single platform that could scale alongside
      their operations. Dispatchers were losing hours each day coordinating
      loads, tracking drivers, and reconciling paperwork.

    <p>
      We designed and built a logistics dashboard that unified shipment
      tracking, driver assignment, and invoicing into one interface. The
      system reduced dispatch time by half and gave the operations team
      real-time visibility into every active load.
